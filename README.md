# Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis  

### 🔹 Introduction to Open-Source Simulator Iverilog  
- **2-SKY130RTL D1SK1 L1** → Introduction to Iverilog: Design & Testbench
  
  🔹 Simulator

Tool that mimics hardware behavior of HDL (Verilog/SystemVerilog) code.

Lets you check functionality before actual hardware implementation.

🔹 Design

Your RTL/Verilog/SystemVerilog code (the circuit you want to build).

Example: counter, ALU, FSM, etc.

🔹 Testbench

A verification code that stimulates the design with inputs.

Checks whether outputs match expected behavior.

Doesn’t synthesize → used only for simulation.

🔹 How Simulator Works

Compiles both design and testbench.

Executes testbench inputs on design.

Produces output + optional waveform data.

🔹 Icarus Verilog (iverilog) Simulation Flow

Write design + testbench.

Compile: iverilog -o sim_out design.v testbench.v

Run: vvp sim_out

Generate waveform (VCD): $dumpfile("wave.vcd"); $dumpvars; inside testbench.

🔹 VCD File (Value Change Dump)

File format storing signal transitions over time.

Generated during simulation for waveform viewing.

🔹 GTKWave

GUI tool to visualize VCD files.

Run: gtkwave wave.vcd

Lets you see signals, timing, glitches, and debug your logic.

### 🔹 Labs using Iverilog and GTKWave  
- **3-SKY130RTL D1SK2 L1** → Lab1: Introduction to lab

Design And Testbench Of 2:1 Multiplexer (MUX) Using Iverilog & GTKWAVE

Circuit Function: A multiplexer selects one input from multiple inputs based on a control signal.

Working:

If sel = 0 → Output y = a

If sel = 1 → Output y = b

Use Case: Data selection, routing signals, implementing logic functions.

Simulation: Implemented in Verilog with a testbench; simulated using Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and waveform observed in GTKWave.

### 🔹 Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis  
- **6-SKY130RTL D1SK3 L1** → Introduction to Yosys
  Yosys

What it is: Open-source framework for RTL synthesis.

Use: Converts Verilog RTL code into a gate-level netlist.

Flow:

Read design (read_verilog)

Run synthesis (synth)

Map to standard cells (abc, dfflibmap)

Write output netlist (write_verilog)

Supports: FPGA flows + ASIC flows (like SKY130).

Why important: First step in RTL → GDSII design flow.

  <img width="1308" height="675" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59dc3b02-59ea-4f82-aa6a-f727f8a0998a" />

🔹 Verifying Synthesis with Icarus Verilog & GTKWave

Step 1: Simulate RTL design with testbench → generate wave.vcd → check logic in GTKWave.

Step 2: Run synthesis in Yosys → get gate-level netlist.

Step 3: Simulate the netlist with same testbench using iverilog → generate new wave.vcd.

Step 4: Compare RTL waveform vs Gate-level waveform in GTKWave.

If both match → synthesis is correct.

  <img width="1311" height="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/638d40e7-7172-4a7f-8c29-47b811164cf2" />


- **7-SKY130RTL D1SK3 L2** → Logic Synthesis (Part 1)

🔹 Synthesis

Definition: Process of converting RTL (Register Transfer Level) design into a gate-level representation using standard cell library.

Input:

Verilog RTL code

Technology library (.lib)

Constraints (timing, area, power)

Output:

Gate-level netlist (Verilog)

Reports (timing, area, power)

  <img width="985" height="672" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d35a28e1-e94c-4a0d-a4d7-d8b8f2c00c7b" />

  🔹 What is .lib?

A timing library file used in synthesis.

Describes each standard cell:

Function (logic equation)

Timing (delay, setup, hold)

Power consumption

Area

Input to synthesis → helps tool map RTL to real gates.

Why Different Flavours of Gates?

Same logic gate (e.g., NAND2) can have different drive strengths/sizes (like NAND2_X1, NAND2_X2, NAND2_X4).

Reason:

Faster cells → handle high load but consume more area/power.

Slower cells → smaller area, less power, but higher delay.

Synthesis tool chooses based on timing + power constraints.


<img width="985" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6c3d71-4b54-4a07-9f51-d62a3ed2d5a8" />

 Why We Need Slower Cells?

Hold Violation: Happens when data travels too fast and reaches the next flip-flop before the hold time is satisfied.

Fix: Add delay in the path → one way is to use slower cells instead of fast cells.

Result: Slower cells increase path delay, preventing data from arriving too early → hold violation removed.

- **8-SKY130RTL D1SK3 L3** → Logic Synthesis (Part 2)

🔹 Fast Cells vs Slow Cells

| Feature               | Fast Cell                             | Slow Cell                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Delay**             | Low (quick switching)                 | High (slower switching)                      |
| **Power Consumption** | High (more dynamic power)             | Low (less power)                             |
| **Area**              | Large (bigger transistors)            | Small (smaller transistors)                  |
| **Use Case**          | Critical paths (timing-sensitive)     | Non-critical paths (hold/power optimization) |
| **Hold/Setup Effect** | May cause hold violations if too fast | Helps fix hold violations by adding delay    |

  <img width="1256" height="546" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e56b5c6-aef4-44f5-9ed6-4b72d269eacb" />

  
- **10-SKY130RTL D1SK4 L2** → Lab3: Yosys Good Mux (Part 2)

<img width="1190" height="363" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96ebefb2-4a4f-403c-8368-8cadf6d9138a" />

  This is a gate-level netlist view from Yosys showing technology mapping. Here’s a short explanation of the mapping shown in your image:

Inputs & Buffers

i0, i1, and sel are inputs.

Each input goes through a BUF (buffer) which strengthens the signal for further gates.

Mapped Standard Cells

$53 → sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkinv_1 : This is an inverter applied on i0.

$54 → sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_1 : This is a 2-input NAND gate applied on i1 and sel.

AOI Gate (Complex Mapping)

$55 → sky130_fd_sc_hd__o21ai_0 : Yosys has mapped the combination of inverter and NAND into a complex gate (OR-AND-Invert) to optimize area/delay.

Inputs A1, A2, B1 are connected from previous cells.

Output Buffer

The final output y goes through a BUF for clean output drive.

✅ Summary:

Yosys converts RTL (like assign y = sel ? i1 : i0) into standard cells.

Simple logic (i0 inverter, i1 NAND) is mapped to basic cells.

Logic combination is optimized into complex cells (o21ai) to reduce area/delay.

Buffers are added for proper driving of signals.

- **11-SKY130RTL D1SK4 L3** → Lab3: Yosys Good Mux (Part 3)
  
This file is a gate‑level Verilog netlist written by a synthesis tool after mapping RTL to real SKY130 standard cells.

The top comment records the synthesis tool/version; the module line shows the block name and its ports (inputs like i0, i1, sel and outputs like y).

Internal wire declarations create nets that connect the pins of instantiated cells inside the design.

Instances such as clkinv (inverter), nand2 (2‑input NAND), and o21ai (Y = NAND(OR(A1,A2), B1)) implement the logic using SKY130 HD cells.

Pin maps like .A(sig) or .A1(sig) connect signals to each cell’s pins; each instance drives or consumes the declared wires.

Final assign statements hook the module’s outputs to the appropriate internal nets driven by those cell instances.

Functionally, this particular mix realizes a 2:1 mux structure, so tracing from inputs through these gates to the outputs reveals the mux behaviour

# Day 2 - Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles  

### 🔹 Introduction to Timing .libs  
- **12-SKY130RTL D2SK1 L1** → Lab4: Introduction to .lib (Part 1)
  
    📌 What is a .lib file?

.lib = Library Exchange Format (LEF/Liberty format) file.

It is an ASCII text file provided by the standard cell vendor.

It describes timing, power, and functional behavior of standard cells used in ASIC/SoC design.

Input to logic synthesis, timing analysis, and PnR tools.

📌 What is present inside .lib?

Cell Definitions

Each standard cell (INV, NAND, Flip-Flop, etc.) has a block.

Functional description of the cell (Boolean equation).

Timing Information

Delay tables (rise/fall delays, setup/hold, clk→Q, etc.).

Slew-dependent and load-dependent delay data.

Power Information

Dynamic power (switching power).

Leakage power.

Internal power.

Operating Conditions (PVT)

Process corner (TT, SS, FF, etc.).

Voltage values.

Temperature values.

Other info

Pin capacitance.

Input/output constraints.

Cell area.


📌 What Is PVT = Process, Voltage, Temperature
1. Process

Variation due to fabrication (doping, lithography, etc.).

Corners: FF (fast), SS (slow), TT (typical).

Effect:

FF → gates are faster (low delay, more leakage).

SS → gates are slower (high delay, less leakage).

2. Voltage

Supply voltage fluctuations.

Effect:

High Vdd → faster switching, more power.

Low Vdd → slower switching, less power.

3. Temperature

Operating environment heat.

Effect:

High Temp → slower switching, more leakage.

Low Temp → faster switching, less leakage.

  Snapshot Of .lib file

<img width="318" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108e978e-04c4-4324-8b02-05ff6fa01344" />

<img width="747" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd25a85-352b-4092-a370-e5f9d4e1d9fa" />

- **14-SKY130RTL D2SK1 L3** → Lab4: Introduction to .lib (Part 3)
  
  📌 Cells with Different Features

Same logic cell (e.g., AND gate) can have different variants.

Example: AND2_X1, AND2_X2, AND2_X4 …

X1 → small area, low power, slow.

X4 → larger area, higher power, faster.

Below is the snapshot of different features for same and cell they have different area,power and many more features which vary.

  <img width="1192" height="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bf5cb30-2b69-41ec-8973-d09b9d9c3bf2" />
 

### 🔹 Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis  
- **15-SKY130RTL D2SK2 L1** → Lab5: Hierarchical vs Flat (Part 1)
  📌 Flat vs Hierarchical Synthesis
1. Flat Synthesis

Entire RTL → flattened into one big netlist.

No module boundaries preserved.

Pros:

Better optimization (tool sees whole design).

Can reduce area/delay.

Cons:

Very large netlist → high runtime + memory.

Debugging harder (lost hierarchy).

2. Hierarchical Synthesis

RTL modules synthesized separately → then connected at top level.

Module boundaries are preserved.

Pros:

Easier debug & reuse.

Faster runtime, less memory.

Useful for very large designs (SoCs).

Cons:

Less global optimization.

May lead to slightly worse area/timing than flat.

Verilog to code to understand the hierarchical synthesis:

<img width="541" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79b1e0f9-6a95-4dc1-ae28-39595e8c419f" />

It consiste of two modules and their conncetion are shown in Netlist.There is hierarchy between modules so it is hierarchical synthesis.Synthesis is done by tool called yosys.

<img width="336" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b6525b-1809-4434-a4af-faa86d2bcc26" />

Netlist:

<img width="363" height="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65b3139c-7ff0-4cab-8fbb-67b83579f296" />



- **16-SKY130RTL D2SK2 L2** → Lab5: Hierarchical vs Flat (Part 2)
The Snapshot below shows difference between flat and hierarchical synthesis netlists.

Left side of snapshot is hierarchical synthesis in which hierarchy is preserved as we can see different modules but in right side diagram hierarchy is not preserved so it is flat synthesis.

<img width="842" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e12a578b-d15d-41af-b893-8fb00ef149e4" />

The gatelevel netlist for flat synthesis is shown below

<img width="1257" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28294ef0-f055-4ad5-bb5d-bfce41fbc29e" />

📌 Why Module-Level (Hierarchical) Synthesis is Needed

Scalability

Big SoCs have millions of gates → flat synthesis is too heavy (runtime, memory).

Breaking into modules makes synthesis manageable.

Reusability

Standard IPs (e.g., UART, SPI, CPU cores) are pre-synthesized and reused in multiple projects.

No need to resynthesize every time.

Debug & ECO (Engineering Change Order)

Easier to locate and fix issues at module level.

Flat netlist = one giant blob (hard to debug).

Parallel Development

Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously.

Later integrate at top level.

Runtime Efficiency

Hierarchical synthesis reduces compile time drastically.

Useful during iterative design flows.

### 🔹 Flop Coding Styles & Optimization  
- **17-SKY130RTL D2SK3 L1** → Why Flops? Flop coding styles (Part 1)

📌 What are Flops?

Flop = Flip-Flop (usually D-FF in digital design).

A sequential element that stores 1 bit of data.

Captures input at clock edge (positive or negative).

📌 Why Flops are Used (Advantages)

Avoid Glitches

Combinational logic can create glitches due to unequal path delays.

Flops sample data only at clock edge → glitches in between are ignored.

Synchronization

Aligns signals with the clock → ensures stable timing.

Break Long Paths

Insert flops (pipelining) → reduce critical path delay, improve frequency.

Data Storage

Used to hold states in FSMs, registers, counters, etc.

Reliable Design

Makes design predictable for STA (Static Timing Analysis).

- **18-SKY130RTL D2SK3 L2** → Flop coding styles (Part 2)

 📌 Asynchronous vs Synchronous Reset
 
| Feature                | **Asynchronous Reset**                     | **Synchronous Reset**                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **When it acts**       | Immediately, **independent of clock**      | Only at **active clock edge**            |
| **Timing**             | Can reset FF **anytime**                   | Reset happens **with clock**             |
| **Glitch sensitivity** | May cause glitches if not handled properly | Safer from glitches                      |
| **Design use**         | For **fast, immediate reset**              | For **predictable, clock-aligned reset** |
| **Example in Verilog** | `always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)`     | `always @(posedge clk)` with `if (rst)`  |

The snapshot shows different D-FF implementations with synchronous and asynchronous resets, written in Verilog and simulated using Iverilog

- **21-SKY130RTL D2SK3 L5** → Interesting optimizations (Part 1)
  
📌 Multiplication by 2ⁿ Optimization

Observation: Multiplying a binary number by 2, 4, 8… (2ⁿ) can be done by simple left shift.

Logic optimization:

Instead of using a multiplier hardware, just append zeros to the LSB.

Example: A * 2 → A << 1 (shift left by 1 bit)

Example: A * 8 → A << 3 (shift left by 3 bits)

Benefit:

No complex multiplier needed.

Saves area, power, and delay.

So we can see clearly in snapshot that no memory cells process are requied.

<img width="522" height="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da85481-aa39-4072-bb30-b7220b31dc83" />

We can clearly see in netlist which is shown below there is no complex hardware these what is the benefit of the optimization.

<img width="347" height="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5f2949e-7f32-4369-90d4-98949ed27ac9" />

Simplifying a digital circuit to reduce the number of gates, levels, or inputs without changing its functionality.

Purpose:

Reduce chip area

Increase speed (lower propagation delay)

Reduce power consumption

Make design cost-effective

Techniques:

Boolean algebra simplification

Karnaugh Map (K-map)

Quine–McCluskey method

Example 1: Multiplication by 2

Original: Use a multiplier to compute Y = A × 2

Optimized: Use a left shift operation: Y = A << 1 (no multiplier needed)

Example 2: Logic simplification

Original: F = A·B + A·~B

Constant Propagation

Definition:
Constant propagation is a technique where constant values (0 or 1) in a circuit are used to simplify logic expressions, eliminating unnecessary gates.

Why it is used:

Reduces the number of gates

Simplifies the circuit

Improves speed and power efficiency

Example:

Original logic:

F = A·1 + B·0


Step-by-step simplification using constant propagation:

A·1 = A (anything AND 1 is itself)

B·0 = 0 (anything AND 0 is 0)

So, the optimized logic:

F = A + 0
F = A


Key idea: The constants (1 and 0) “propagate” through the logic and simplify the circuit.

Optimized: F = A

  Sequential Logic Optimization

Definition:
Sequential logic optimization improves circuits that have memory elements (flip-flops, latches) along with combinational logic, aiming to reduce area, increase speed, or lower power without changing functionality.

Why it is used:

Reduce critical path delay → faster circuits

Minimize number of flip-flops and gates → smaller area

Optimize power consumption

Improve timing and throughput



Definition:
In sequential circuits, constant optimization uses known constant inputs or states to simplify flip-flops and combinational logic that depends on them.

Example:

Suppose we have a sequential circuit with:

DFF1: Q1 = D1
D1 = A · 1


Here, 1 is a constant.

Optimization: D1 = A · 1 = A

Flip-flop still stores Q1 = A, but the AND gate is removed.

Another example (state-based):

State machine table:

Current State	Input	Next State
S0	0	S0
S0	1	S1

If we know input is always 1 during a certain operation, we can propagate this constant:

Remove transitions that depend on 0

Simplify logic for next state computation

Key Idea:

Constants propagate through combinational logic between flip-flops.

Eliminates unnecessary gates and sometimes reduces flip-flop usage.

- **25-SKY130RTL D3SK1 L3** → Optimizations (Part 3)

  Advanced Techniques

Retiming

What: Moving flip-flops across combinational logic to balance path delays.

Why: Reduces the critical path and increases maximum clock frequency.

Example:

Before Retiming: FF -> combinational logic -> FF
After Retiming: combinational logic -> FF -> combinational logic


This can allow the circuit to run at a higher clock without changing behavior.

Cloning (or Register Cloning)

What: Duplicating combinational logic blocks so multiple registers can share computations.

Why: Reduces fan-out and load on critical paths, improving timing.

Example:

One logic block feeds 4 FFs → clone the logic so each FF gets its own block → faster clock


Other common sequential optimizations

Clock gating: Turn off flip-flops that are not needed to save power

State encoding optimization: Reduce flip-flop count by smart encoding of states

Pipeline balancing: Evenly distribute logic between stages to improve throughput

# Day 4 - GLS, Blocking vs Non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch  

### 🔹 GLS, Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Blocking/Non-blocking Statements  
- **33-SKY130RTL D4SK1 L1** → GLS Concepts & Flow using Iverilog
  
Gate Level Simulation (GLS)

Definition: GLS is simulation of the synthesized gate-level netlist instead of the RTL code.

After synthesis, your design is represented using logic gates (AND, OR, FFs, MUX, etc.) from the technology library.

GLS uses these gate models + optional timing info to verify correctness at the gate level.

🔹 Why GLS is needed?

Equivalence Check: Ensure synthesized netlist behaves the same as RTL.

Timing Verification: With SDF (delays), ensures design meets setup/hold timing.

X-Propagation Checks: Detect uninitialized registers, reset issues, glitches.

Library Mapping: Verify actual cells (from .lib) are functioning as expected.

Confidence before Layout: Ensures no mismatch before place-and-route.

GLS using Icarus Verilog

<img width="1227" height="547" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95a2986-18f1-4640-8f8c-3f8f9d0e1972" />

- **34-SKY130RTL D4SK1 L2** → Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch
  
🔹 Simulation Mismatches

A simulation mismatch occurs when the RTL simulation result ≠ GLS simulation result.

👉 This usually means the RTL code was written in a way that did not model real hardware correctly, so synthesis interpreted it differently.

Common causes:

Missing sensitivity list (biggest reason in Verilog).

Blocking (=) vs Non-blocking (<=) misuse in sequential logic.

Latch inference due to incomplete assignments.

Uninitialized signals – GLS may show X where RTL showed 0.

Timing differences (RTL ignores delays, GLS includes gate delays).

🔹 Missing Sensitivity Problem

Example (wrong code):
always @(a) begin   // Missing 'b' in sensitivity list
  y = a & b;
end


In RTL simulation:
y will update only when a changes. If b changes alone → no update, so simulation output is stale.

In Synthesis (GLS):
Tool infers a combinational gate AND(a, b), so y changes whenever a or b changes.

👉 Result = RTL vs GLS mismatch.

Correct code (fix):
always @(*) begin    // or always @(a or b)
  y = a & b;
end


@(*) automatically adds all signals in RHS (a, b) → consistent with synthesized hardware.

Now both RTL and GLS match.

🔹 Why this is dangerous?

During RTL sim, you might think design is fine (no bugs).

But after synthesis → GLS shows mismatch (functional failure).

This is why coding guidelines recommend using always @(*) for combinational logic and always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) for sequential logic.
- **35-SKY130RTL D4SK1 L3** → Blocking vs Non-Blocking Statements in Verilog
  🔹 Simulation Mismatches in Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments
1. Blocking (=)

Executes immediately in the given order inside always.

Acts like software statements.

Can cause unintended behavior in RTL sim if used in sequential always blocks.

👉 Example of mismatch

// Sequential block with blocking assignment
always @(posedge clk) begin
  q = d;
  r = q;   // Uses the updated q immediately (in RTL sim)
end


RTL Simulation:
r gets the new value of d in the same clock cycle (because q updated immediately).

Synthesis/GLS:
Hardware is two flip-flops in series (q → r). r should get the old value of q.
→ Mismatch!

✅ Correct way: use non-blocking (<=) in sequential logic.

2. Non-Blocking (<=)

Executes in parallel at the end of the always block.

Models real flip-flop behavior.

Ensures all RHS values are sampled first, then updates happen together.

👉 Example (correct)

always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= d;
  r <= q;  // r gets old q, as expected
end


RTL Simulation: Matches real hardware.

GLS: No mismatch.

🔹 Common Caveats (Gotchas)
🟢 Blocking (=) Caveats

Good for combinational logic (always @(*)) → ensures step-by-step evaluation.

Dangerous in sequential blocks (always @(posedge clk)) → can cause mismatches.

Can lead to simulation race conditions if multiple always blocks depend on same signal.

🔵 Non-Blocking (<=) Caveats

Must be used for sequential logic (FFs).

If used in combinational always blocks, can cause unexpected latches or unintended parallelism.

always @(*) begin
  y <= a & b;   // BAD: synthesizer may infer latch or strange behavior
end


Order of statements does not matter (all update in parallel). Sometimes makes debugging harder.

🔹 Quick Rule of Thumb

Combinational logic → use = (blocking).

Sequential (clocked) logic → use <= (non-blocking).

Never mix them in the same always block (unless you really know why).
- **36-SKY130RTL D4SK1 L4** → Caveats with Blocking Statements

🔹 Disadvantages of Blocking Assignments (=) in Sequential Logic

One-Cycle Mismatch

RTL sim: values propagate instantly inside same always block.

Real circuit: flip-flops update only on clock edge → output lags by 1 cycle.

❌ Causes wrong pipelining (data looks 1 cycle early in sim).

Race Conditions

If multiple always blocks use blocking assignments, execution order in sim matters.

Real hardware updates in parallel → mismatch.

Hard Debugging

Sim shows design working fine, but on FPGA/ASIC, behavior is different → time lost in bring-up.

🔹 Disadvantages of Non-Blocking Assignments (<=) in Combinational Logic

Latch Inference

Incomplete assignments with <= can create unintended storage elements.

❌ Extra area, timing failures, higher power.

Glitchy Outputs

Since updates happen at end of block, combinational outputs may hold old values → wrong intermediate behavior.

Loss of Ordering Control

In combinational blocks, sometimes order of execution matters (e.g., priority logic).

With <=, all updates happen in parallel → wrong circuit implementation.

🔹 Mixing = and <= in Same Block

❌ Very risky → synthesis tool may still build correct flip-flops, but simulation will show different values depending on ordering.

Leads to unpredictable mismatches → hardest to debug.

# Day 5 - Optimization in Synthesis  

### 🔹 If-Case Constructs  

- **41-SKY130RTL D5SK1 L1** → IF-CASE Constructs (Part 1)
  
🔹 if-else Construct

Used inside always blocks to describe conditional behavior.

Example:

always @(*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = a;
  else
    y = b;
end


👉 Synthesizer infers a MUX (y = sel ? a : b).

🔹 Inferred Latch with if-else

Latch gets inferred when not all cases assign a value to the output in a combinational block.

Example (bug):

always @(*) begin
  if (en)
    y = d;   // What if en = 0? → y not assigned
end


👉 Synthesis assumes you want y to hold its old value → infers a latch.

Problems caused by latch:

Extra area + power.

Timing closure difficulties.

May cause unintended storage behavior.

🔹 Correct way

Always cover all cases in if-else:

always @(*) begin
  if (en)
    y = d;
  else
    y = 0;   // Or some default value
end


Or give a default assignment before condition:

always @(*) begin
  y = 0;        // default
  if (en)
    y = d;
end
- **42-SKY130RTL D5SK1 L2** → IF-CASE Constructs (Part 2)
  🔹 Case Construct

General form:

always @(*) begin
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y = a;
    2'b01: y = b;
    2'b10: y = c;
    default: y = d;
  endcase
end


👉 Synthesizer infers a MUX (y = f(sel)).

🔹 Caveats if default is Missing
1. Inferred Latches

If not all cases are covered and no default, then for some sel values → y not assigned → latch inferred.

always @(*) begin
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y = a;
    2'b01: y = b;
    // Missing sel=2'b10, 2'b11 → y holds old value = LATCH
  endcase
end

2. Simulation Mismatch

RTL sim may leave y as X for uncovered cases,

Synthesis may optimize differently (e.g., latch or don’t-care).
👉 GLS vs RTL mismatch.

3. Unintended Priority

If multiple case statements without default interact, synthesis might create priority logic you didn’t want.

4. Optimization Ambiguity

Tools may treat missing cases as don’t-cares.

Sometimes helpful for optimization, but dangerous → can cause wrong circuit if don’t-cares actually occur in real operation.

🔹 Best Practices

Always use default in case for combinational logic.

Or initialize outputs with a default assignment before case.

always @(*) begin
  y = 0; // default
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y = a;
    2'b01: y = b;
    2'b10: y = c;
    default: y = d;
  endcase
end


For FSMs, default can safely send design to a known reset state if an invalid state occurs.

- **43-SKY130RTL D5SK1 L3** → IF-CASE Constructs (Part 3)
  🔹 Partial Assignment in case

When inside a case block you assign only some signals, and leave others untouched, the untouched signals will retain their previous value.
👉 This causes latch inference in combinational logic.

⚠️ Example (Bug – Partial Assignment)
reg [3:0] y;

always @(*) begin
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y[0] = a;   // Only bit 0 assigned
    2'b01: y[1] = b;   // Only bit 1 assigned
    default: ;         // y[2] and y[3] never assigned
  endcase
end


For some cases, parts of y are not assigned → synthesizer adds latches to hold their old values.

✅ Correct Way (Full Assignment)

Assign entire signal in every case

always @(*) begin
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y = {3'b000, a};
    2'b01: y = {2'b00, b, 1'b0};
    default: y = 4'b0000;
  endcase
end


Or give default assignment before case

always @(*) begin
  y = 4'b0000;   // default → no latch
  case (sel)
    2'b00: y[0] = a;
    2'b01: y[1] = b;
  endcase
end

🔹 Caveats of Partial Assignment

Latch Inference → increases area, power, timing issues.

Simulation vs Synthesis Mismatch → simulation may show X while synthesis infers latch.

Unpredictable Hardware Behavior if unassigned bits are used later.

Hard Debugging → design seems fine in sim but fails in GLS/FPGA.
