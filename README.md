# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program-IIT-Gandhinagar-x-VSD-Week1
Learned Verilog RTL design and simulation using Icarus Verilog &amp; GTKWave, followed by logic synthesis with Yosys on Sky130 PDK. Explored timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis, flip-flop coding, GLS, and key optimization techniques through hands-on labs
